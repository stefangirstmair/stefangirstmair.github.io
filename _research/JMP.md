## The Effect of New Housing Supply in Structural Models: A Forecasting Performance Evaluation


This paper investigates the importance of including data on new housing supply in Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models in forecasting the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), focusing on the U.S. While previous models have added a financial sector and real estate sector, they have largely ignored housing supply. For this, I develop an extended DSGE model that includes both the financial sector and endogenous housing supply and show that forecasting accuracy significantly improves when data on new houses is included. I conduct a rigorous robustness check to confirm the importance of these additions to the model. The findings demonstrate that the combination of model extension and housing supply data is necessary for accurate forecasting during periods of economic crisis. I identify negative housing demand shocks and escalating adjustment costs as primary drivers of the GFC, which propagated into the real economy and got accelerated through the financial sector. Additionally, this paper addresses the zero lower bound challenge in modeling forward guidance using a novel regime change approach, aligning with current macroeconomic research.
