I am a PhD candidate at the Chair of International Macroeconomics and Macroeconometrics at **GSEFM - Goethe University Frankfurt**, from where I will graduate in 2024.
My main research interest is in the field of **Macroeconomics**. There, I specialize in **Monetary Economics**, **Forecasting**, and **Bayesian Econometrcis**.

I have also worked at the **European Central Bank**, where I have established the linked version of the semi-structural model ECB-MC in the Forecasting and Policy Modelling Division (DGE). I am also a regular user and contributer in the [Dynare](https://forum.dynare.org/u/DoubleBass/summary) forum.

I will be available for interviews at both, the 2023-2024 *American Job Market* and *European Job Market*.
