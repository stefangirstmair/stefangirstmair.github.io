## The Effect of New Housing Supply in Structural Models: A Forecasting Performance Evaluation
*Job Market Paper*

This paper investigates the importance of including data on new housing supply in Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models in forecasting the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). While previous models have added a financial sector and real estate sector, they have largely ignored the housing supply. For this, I develop an extended DSGE model that includes both the financial sector and an endogenous housing supply and show that forecasting accuracy significantly improves when data on new houses is included. I conduct a rigorous robustness check to confirm the importance of these additions to the model. The findings demonstrate that the combination of the extended model and housing supply data is necessary for accurate forecasting during periods of economic crisis. Negative housing demand shocks were crucial in the emergence of the GFC, as they propagated into the real economy and got accelerated through the financial sector.

## ECB-MC
Together with Matteo Ciccarelli and the team of the DGE-FPM division of the ECB, I write the paper on their new semi-structural model ECB-MC. Its main usecase is for the creation of the projections of the ECB as well as policy analysis. The existing version consists of five individual models for the Big-5 countries of the euro area. My job is to create a linked version of these five models to enable the division to analyze international spillovers of various shocks. To achieve this I introduce trade and pricing links, as well as common exchange rates and monetary policy. The final model is implemented in their version-control software and workflow and we are currently in the process of writing a paper on the results.


## Determinacy within Different Pricing Regimes and Multi-Country DSGE Models
*Work in progress*

For my second single-authored paper, I work with the new workhorse model in international macroeconomics by Gopinath et al. (2020) and dig deep on the topic of determinacy in different pricing paradigms such as Dominant Currency Pricing, Producer Currency Pricing, and Local Currency Pricing. I find that the setup of a three-country DSGE model enables interesting equilibria where the Taylor principle must not necessarily hold, as is the case of closed economy models. I furthermore investigate the effects of these findings on the transmission of shocks domestically and internationally.

## A Structural Model of the Vietnamese Economy for Policy Analysis
*Work in progress*

In another project together with Michael Binder, Le Van Ha, and Anh H. Le we build a rich three economy DSGE model for Vietnam that also includes the U.S. as the originator of the dominant currency - which all trade is invoiced in - and a rest of the world. All of these interact through trade and are part of the global value chain. We furthermore introduce three different firms in Vietnam to account for the fact that there is considerable heterogeneity on the supply side of the economy, including state owned enterprises, privately owned enterprises, and foreign direct investment enterprises. These firms are subject to asymmetric financial frictions and funding channels and hence effect the propagation of shocks differently. Monetary policy follows an exchange-rate targeting extended Taylor rule that supplements the monetary authorities reserve-requirement target. To this point we have calibrated the model to match Vietnamese data but it is planned to fully estimate it and make it available to policy makers in Vietnam to support their decision making. By comparing it to the baseline model of Gopinath et al. (2020) we find that following a simultaneous negative TFP-shock in all three economies, the trough loss in output for Vietnam in our model is about double the magnitude of the baseline model. This suggests that impact and respective policy responses could potentially be notably more sizable than standard analysis would imply. 

## International Spillover of Forward Guidance: A Story of the U.S. and Euro Area
*Work in progress*

Together with Anh H. Le I also work on a project investigating international spillovers of forward guidance between the U.S. and the Euro Area. To achieve this, we build a large asymmetric two country model and estimate it applying the structural break estimation method. To account for different lengths of binding zero lower bounds and their effect on the analysis, generalized impulse response functions are calculated. With our rich setup, we are trying to answer two main questions. What are the effects of U.S. forward guidance on advanced economies such as the Euro Area? And how does it affect the banking system in both economies?
