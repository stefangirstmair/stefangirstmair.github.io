## Solution, Identification, and Estimation of DSGE Models
*Ph.D.-Level, Prof. Michael Binder, Ph.D.*

*Teaching assistant in the following semesters: winter 23/24, winter 22/23, winter 21/22, winter 19/20*

In this second year Ph.D. course we start by introducing and deriving a baseline DSGE model following for example Fernández-Villaverde & Rubio-Ramírez (2006). In the first part of the course, we solve this model using various well known solution methods for rational expectations models such as Binder & Pesaran (1997), Blanchard & Kahn (1980), Sims (2002), as well as Dynare, and compare them to each other. We also investigate the differences of unique stable solutions to multiple stable solutions. The students are then introduced to the novel structural break approach introduced by Kulish & Pagan (2017) and have to analyze model behavior when deep structural parameters change in an unexpecte, expected, or announced scenario.

The second part focuses on the crucial aspect of identification issues commonly seen in modern DSGE models. After defining the concept of global and local identification we start with a single equation rational expectation model set-up. Naturally, we advance back to the multi equation model established in the first part. Since identification properties are not as easily derived as before we delve into frequency domain time-series econometrics to apply the novel approach of Qu & Tkachenko (2017) to numerically check for identification by calculating Kullback-Leibler distance measures.

The last part of the course focuses on the estimation of structural parameters in linear rational expectation models. Since there is a separate course on Bayesian techniques, we focus on the generalized method of moments (GMM) and maximum likelihood (ML) approaches. One benefit of GMM is that the model solution is not necessary and thus no stance needs to be take on whether the model solution is unique stable or not. In order to estimate the model using ML, we set up and explain the state space representation and derive the Kalman filter.
