## Solution, Identification, and Estimation of DSGE Models
*Ph.D.-Level, Prof. Michael Binder, Ph.D.*

This paper investigates the importance of including data on new housing supply in Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models in forecasting the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). While previous models have added a financial sector and real estate sector, they have largely ignored the housing supply. For this, I develop an extended DSGE model that includes both the financial sector and an endogenous housing supply and show that forecasting accuracy significantly improves when data on new houses is included. I conduct a rigorous robustness check to confirm the importance of these additions to the model. The findings demonstrate that the combination of the extended model and housing supply data is necessary for accurate forecasting during periods of economic crisis. Negative housing demand shocks were crucial in the emergence of the GFC, as they propagated into the real economy and got accelerated through the financial sector.

## Macroeconomics 1 (BMAK)
*B.Sc.-Level, Prof. Michael Binder, Ph.D.*
Collaborating closely with Matteo Ciccarelli and the dedicated team at the DGE-FPM division of the ECB, I am involved in writing a paper detailing the intricacies of their semi-structural model, ECB-MC. This model plays a pivotal role in generating ECB's projections and conducting crucial policy analyses. The current iteration comprises five distinct models tailored for the major economies within the euro area. My primary responsibility revolves around developing a version that links these five models, empowering the division to analyze cross-country spillovers stemming from a diverse set of shocks. This involves incorporating essential elements like trade and pricing links, as well as common exchange rates and monetary policy across the models. To facilitate wider accessibility and utilization, I ensure that the final model is integrated into their version-control software and workflow, aimed to benefit other divisions within the organization.
